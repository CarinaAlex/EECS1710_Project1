# Summary of Game

The rabbit can hide inside the house using the above commands. The rabbit eats the wheat if you cause it to move towards it and collide with the wheat.

Once the wheat is eaten, and if it is nightime, the fox will wake up and start to chase the rabbit. If the rabbit does not make it back into the house before it is caught by the fox, then the fox will eat the rabbit. The fox is always attracted to the rabbit, chasing it whenever it is awake.

# Keyboard Commands

**o = open garage door** - this allows for the rabbit to hide in the house when the fox is after it. You must place the cursor on the open door for the rabbit to reach it and avoid being eaten.

**c = close garage door**

**d = daytime** - this changes the time of day, which makes the wheat grow back. The fox is awake in the daytime.

**n = nightime** - this changes the time of day to night, which puts the fox to sleep. The fox only wakes up in the daytime when the rabbit eats the wheat.
 
**r = move the rabbit**, it will move in the direction of the cursor and stop at the cursors position. 

**f = move the fox**, however the fox will move on its own and chase the rabbit to eat it when it is awake.
